####Initial Requirement

Consider i made an app to handle whatsapps messages inputs and return the answers, at firs we received the messages from scala360 with their own input structure format, then we start to receive messages for knry, later direct messages, but there is no limit to the amount of different formats, becuase later we need to create a connection to handle other kind of channels like: instagram, werb, telegram, 3d party, etc, or maybe i need to receive and return the messages using a briker like redis or a websocket connection to improve realtime for audio for example, the, my goal is to create a UNIQUE and ONLY kind of message with attributes to be handled just this ONLY type of input in ALL THE MICROSERVICES.  Example:  when i send a text to whatsapp meta graph :  I should send something like:  

```{
  "messaging_product": "whatsapp",
  "recipient_type": "individual",
  "to": "+16505551234",
  "type": "text",
  "text": {
    "preview_url": true,
    "body": "My text"
  }````

but the same message to telegram is something like 

```{
  "chat_id": "123456789",  // Chat ID or username
  "text": "My text",
  "disable_web_page_preview": false
}```

 or google chat:  
 
 ```{
  "text": "My text"
}````

If were a websocket is complete diferent, etc.  and every channel has their own method, authorization, etc.  Is impposible to allow my app to deal with this infinite formats.   My app will handle all type of modern messages in human communication today, some of this could be:  text, images, videos, documents, call to action buttons, flows, lists, interactive lists, links, interactive links, contacts, address, reactions, stickers, templates, etc.  Some messages mix in one message different types of messages.  Some plartforms send in the same message or in other kind of communication status about that message input or output when I send it.  And finally the channles are a lot, this is an initial list:  WhatsApp
Telegram
Google Chat
Microsoft Teams
Facebook Messenger
Instagram Direct (Business Accounts)
Slack
etc


Enterprise Communication Platforms
1. Salesforce LiveMessage
2. Zendesk Chat
3. Intercom
4. Freshchat
5. Genesys Cloud
etc.

This actual app was my first intent, but lacks in an deep analisys of all the types of messages and platforms to really create a solid translaction app that can deal with new channels implementation in a esay way.  Your mission is:  1.  Write a complete plan of what we need to do, consider and execute before start to creating or changing actual files in this app.  2.  Write a concise explanation of how this babel app will handle the inputs messages from rest, redis broker or websocket, will transform in a unique format and will send to a 3rd party app to process using redis, rest or websocket based in the configuration. 3. Propose a CLEAR and UNIQUE: INPUT and OUTPUT message format for my app, that format need to handle all posible combinations of types of messages in order to properly identify it, prooccessed by my app and properly convert it back to the destination channel, no matter if a message input came from one channel and need to be delivery to the same or other different or differents channles.  You don't need to write any code now, just create the most clever plan to implement with a lot of details, examples, explanation, comments, code examples, etc in order to use that plan for the implementation.  This plan need to have not only the implementation plan, but how a new channel or type of message should be implemented in the future.

####PLAN FROM REQUIREMENT

Here is a comprehensive plan to enhance your application to handle multiple messaging platforms with various message types, transforming them into a unique internal format for consistent processing.

#### Comprehensive Plan for Multi-Platform Messaging Integration

###Part 1: Comprehensive Plan Before Implementation

##1. Requirements Analysis
Before proceeding, we need to clearly outline the requirements:
Scalability: The app should easily accommodate new messaging platforms and message types.
Flexibility: Support various input/output channels like REST, Redis, and WebSocket.
Extensibility: Simplify the process of adding new channels or message types in the future.
Standardization: Develop a universal message format to normalize all messages.
Robustness: Ensure the system can handle complex message structures, including mixed content types.
Configuration Management: Use a configuration-based approach to manage platform-specific settings and credentials.

##2. Key Considerations
Universal Message Format: Define a comprehensive message schema that can represent all possible message types and platforms.
Platform Adapters: Implement adapters for each platform to handle the conversion to and from the universal message format.
Message Pipeline: Establish a processing pipeline for ingestion, transformation, processing, and dispatching.
Input/Output Handlers: Create modular handlers for different communication protocols (REST, Redis, WebSocket).
Third-Party Integration: Design an interface for integrating with external applications or services.
Future Expansion: Ensure the architecture allows for easy addition of new platforms and message types.

##3. Step-by-Step Implementation Plan
#Step 1: Define a Universal Message Schema
Create a Comprehensive Message Model: Using Pydantic models for type hints and validation.
Include All Possible Fields: Cater to text, media, interactive elements, status updates, and metadata.
Ensure Extensibility: Allow the schema to accommodate future message types or platform-specific extensions.
#Step 2: Implement Platform Adapters
Create a Base Adapter Class

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class PlatformAdapter(ABC):

    @abstractmethod
    def to_universal(self, platform_message: dict) -> MessageModel:
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def from_universal(self, universal_message: MessageModel) -> dict:
        pass
```

Develop Platform-Specific Adapters: Implement to_universal and from_universal methods for each platform.
#Step 3: Refactor Input Handlers
Modular Input Handlers: Design handlers for REST endpoints, Redis subscribers, and WebSocket connections.
Dynamic Routing: Use the platform identifier to route messages to the appropriate adapter.
#Step 4: Develop the Processing Pipeline
Message Validation: Validate messages against the universal schema upon ingestion.
Asynchronous Processing: Use Celery with Redis for background task processing.
Business Logic Implementation: Process messages using the standardized format.
#Step 5: Implement Output Handlers
Transform Messages for Output: Utilize platform adapters to convert messages back to platform-specific formats.
Send Messages via Appropriate Channels: REST clients, Redis publishers, or WebSocket connections.
#Step 6: Integrate Third-Party Processing
Flexible Integration Points: Allow the app to send messages to external services for further processing.
Configurable Communication Protocols: Based on settings, choose between REST, Redis, or WebSocket for integration.
#Step 7: Configuration Management
Centralized Configuration Files: Use environment variables and config files to manage platform-specific settings.
Dynamic Loading of Configurations: Load settings at runtime to support adding new platforms without code changes.
#Step 8: Testing and Validation
Unit Tests: Write tests for individual components.
Integration Tests: Ensure components work together as expected.
Test with Real Data Samples: Validate the system with sample messages from different platforms.
#Step 9: Documentation
Detailed Documentation: Explain the architecture, message schema, adapters, and how to add new platforms.
Code Examples: Provide examples for common use cases and extensions.

##4. Future-Proofing
Plugin Architecture: Consider using a plugin system to load new platform adapters dynamically.
Logging and Monitoring: Implement comprehensive logging for debugging and performance monitoring.
Performance Optimization: Explore using asynchronous IO and message brokers to handle high loads.

###Part 2: Explanation of Message Handling Process

##1. Message Ingestion

#Input Channels
REST API: Expose endpoints for platforms that send HTTP requests.
Redis Broker: Subscribe to Redis channels for message queues.
WebSocket: Maintain WebSocket connections for real-time communication.
#Platform Identification
Each message includes a platform field to identify its source.
#Example Input Handler

```python
  @app.post("/webhook")
  async def webhook(request: Request):
      raw_message = await request.json()
      platform = raw_message.get("platform")
      adapter = get_adapter(platform)
      universal_message = adapter.to_universal(raw_message)
      process_message.delay(universal_message.dict())
      return {"status": "Message received"}
```
##2. Message Transformation
#Platform Adapters
Convert platform-specific messages to the universal format (MessageModel).
Handle any platform-specific nuances or data mappings.
#Universal Message Format
A standardized MessageModel ensures consistent processing.
##3. Processing Pipeline
#Asynchronous Task Queue
Use Celery to process messages asynchronously.
Tasks consume messages from the queue and execute business logic.
#Business Logic
Implement the core functionality of message handling.
Can include sending messages to external services.
##4. Message Dispatching
#Transforming Back to Platform Format
Use the from_universal method in the adapter to convert messages.
#Output Channels
Send messages via REST APIs, publish to Redis, or emit via WebSocket.
#Example Output Handler
```python
  def send_message(universal_message: MessageModel):
      adapter = get_adapter(universal_message.platform)
      platform_message = adapter.from_universal(universal_message)
      platform_client = get_platform_client(universal_message.platform)
      platform_client.send(platform_message)
```
##5. Configuration-Based Routing
#Dynamic Configuration
Routing and processing are based on configurations, allowing for flexible behavior.
#Scenarios
Direct Reply: Send the response back to the originating platform.
Cross-Platform Messaging: Forward messages to other platforms as needed.
Third-Party Processing: Route messages to external applications.

###Part 3: Proposed Universal Message Format
##Message Schema Definition
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Optional, List, Dict, Any

class MessageModel(BaseModel):
    message_id: str = Field(..., description="Unique identifier of the message")
    platform: str = Field(..., description="Originating platform identifier")
    sender_id: str = Field(..., description="Sender's unique identifier")
    receiver_id: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Receiver's unique identifier")
    timestamp: str = Field(..., description="Message timestamp in ISO 8601 format")
    message_type: str = Field(..., description="Type of the message (text, media, interactive, etc.)")
    content: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Text content of the message")
    media: Optional[List[Dict[str, Any]]] = Field(None, description="List of media contents")
    interactive: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = Field(None, description="Interactive elements like buttons or lists")
    metadata: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = Field(None, description="Additional data and platform-specific information")
    status: Optional[str] = Field(None, description="Message status (sent, delivered, read)")
```
Field Explanations
message_id: Ensures message traceability across the system.
platform: Allows platform-specific processing and routing.
sender_id / receiver_id: Identifies communication parties.
timestamp: Standardized time format for consistency.
message_type: Helps in processing logic based on type.
content: For plain text messages.
media: List of media items, each with details like type, URL, and caption.
interactive: Contains elements like buttons, lists, or forms.
metadata: Stores any additional data, including platform-specific fields.
status: Tracks message delivery and read statuses.

##Examples
Text Message Example
```
{
  "message_id": "msg_001",
  "platform": "whatsapp",
  "sender_id": "+1234567890",
  "receiver_id": "+0987654321",
  "timestamp": "2023-10-11T12:00:00Z",
  "message_type": "text",
  "content": "Hello!",
  "metadata": {}
}
```
Media Message Example
```
{
  "message_id": "msg_002",
  "platform": "telegram",
  "sender_id": "user_abc",
  "receiver_id": "bot_xyz",
  "timestamp": "2023-10-11T12:05:00Z",
  "message_type": "media",
  "media": [
    {
      "type": "image",
      "url": "https://example.com/photo.jpg",
      "caption": "Check this out!"
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {}
}
```
Interactive Message Example
```
{
  "message_id": "msg_003",
  "platform": "slack",
  "sender_id": "U123456",
  "receiver_id": "C654321",
  "timestamp": "2023-10-11T12:10:00Z",
  "message_type": "interactive",
  "content": "Choose an option",
  "interactive": {
    "type": "buttons",
    "buttons": [
      {"text": "Yes", "value": "yes"},
      {"text": "No", "value": "no"}
    ]
  },
  "metadata": {}
}
```

##Handling Complex Scenarios
Mixed Content Messages: Use a combination of content, media, and interactive fields.
Status Updates: Update the status field to reflect message delivery states.
Platform-Specific Data: Include in metadata to keep the universal format clean.
##Extensibility
#New Message Types
Add new fields or expand existing ones in the MessageModel.
Use inheritance or composition if necessary.
#Platform Extensions
Use the metadata field for platform-specific extensions without altering the core schema.


###Part 4: Guidelines for Adding New Channels or Message Types
##Adding a New Channel
#Implement a New Adapter
Create Adapter Class
```python
     class NewPlatformAdapter(PlatformAdapter):

         def to_universal(self, platform_message: dict) -> MessageModel:
             # Conversion logic from platform message to universal format
             pass

         def from_universal(self, universal_message: MessageModel) -> dict:
             # Conversion logic from universal format to platform message
             pass
```
Handle Platform-Specific Nuances: Consider authentication, message structures, rate limits, etc.
#Update Input/Output Handlers
Input Handler
Add routes or listeners specific to the new platform.
Output Handler
Update the sending mechanism to communicate with the new platform's API or protocol.
#Update Configuration
Settings
Add new configurations (API keys, endpoints) to the config files.
Dynamic Loading
Ensure the system loads these settings without code changes.
#Testing
Unit Tests
Test the adapter methods with sample messages.
Integration Tests
Verify end-to-end message flow with the new platform.
##Adding a New Message Type
#Extend the Message Schema
Update MessageModel
Add new fields or subclasses to represent the new message type.
Maintain Backward Compatibility
Ensure existing message types are unaffected.
#Update Adapters
Platform Adapters
Modify to_universal and from_universal methods to handle the new message type.
#Modify Processing Logic
Business Logic
Update the processing pipeline to accommodate the new type.
Validation
Add validation rules for the new fields.
#Documentation
Update Documentation
Include details about the new message type in the developer docs.
Provide Examples
Show sample messages and how they are handled.

###Conclusion
By following this plan, we can build a robust, scalable, and flexible messaging application capable of handling a wide array of platforms and message types. The key is to abstract platform-specific details using adapters and to standardize messages using a universal format. This architecture not only streamlines current operations but also simplifies future expansions.

# **Integrate Scala360 Channel**
   - **Create Adapter:** Implement `Scala360Adapter` to handle message conversions.
   - **Develop Controller:** Create `process_scala360_message` to process incoming messages.
   - **Set Up Router:** Establish `scala360_routes.py` to handle Scala360 endpoints.
   - **Update Routes:** Include the Scala360 router in `routes/__init__.py`.
   - **Testing:** Write unit and integration tests for Scala360 integration.
   - **Documentation:** Update developer docs with Scala360 integration details.

### Part 5: Configuration Management for Outbound Messaging

#### Objective

- **Decouple Configuration Data**: Separate the configuration details required for sending outbound messages from the message processing logic.
- **Centralize Configurations**: Create a centralized system to store and retrieve configurations like tokens, webhook URLs, and other necessary credentials.
- **Ensure Security**: Handle sensitive information securely, avoiding exposure in logs or unauthorized access.
- **Flexibility**: Allow configurations to be updated without redeploying the application.
  
#### Proposed Strategy

1. **Configuration Service**

   - **Description**: Implement a configuration service or module within the app that can store and retrieve configuration data based on the platform and other identifiers.
   - **Storage**: Use a secure database (e.g., PostgreSQL, Redis) to store configurations.
   - **Access Patterns**: Configurations can be fetched based on keys like `platform`, `sender_id`, `receiver_id`, or `conversation_id`.

2. **Configuration Model**

   - **Data Model**: Define a `ConfigurationModel` that includes fields such as `platform`, `token`, `webhook_url`, `conversation_id`, and any other necessary fields.
   - **Example Model:**

     ```python
     class ConfigurationModel(BaseModel):
         platform: str
         sender_id: Optional[str]
         receiver_id: Optional[str]
         conversation_id: Optional[str]
         token: str
         webhook_url: str
         additional_params: Dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict)
     ```

3. **Configuration Retrieval**

   - **Lookup Logic**: When sending an outbound message, the app will retrieve the necessary configuration based on the message's `platform` and `receiver_id` (or other identifiers as needed).
   - **Caching**: Implement caching for configurations to improve performance.

4. **Integration with Message Dispatching**

   - **Modular Design**: Modify the `message_dispatcher` to utilize the configuration service when sending messages.
   - **Implementation Steps**:
     - **Fetch Configuration**: Before dispatching a message, fetch the relevant configuration.
     - **Use Configuration**: Use the fetched tokens, URLs, etc., to properly send the message without exposing this logic to the processing app.

5. **Security Considerations**

   - **Encryption**: Store sensitive data like tokens and secrets encrypted at rest.
   - **Access Control**: Ensure only authorized parts of the application can access the configuration service.
   - **Secrets Management**: Consider using a secrets manager (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) for handling sensitive configurations.

6. **Administrative Interface**

   - **Configuration Management UI**: Develop an admin interface to manage configurations, allowing updates without code changes or redeployment.
   - **Roles and Permissions**: Implement role-based access control for the admin interface.

7. **Error Handling and Logging**

   - **Graceful Failures**: If configurations are missing or invalid, handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.
   - **Logging**: Log configuration access and errors without exposing sensitive information.

#### Implementation Plan

- **Step 1**: Design and implement the `ConfigurationModel` and create the configuration service/module.
- **Step 2**: Update the `message_dispatcher` to retrieve and use configurations when sending messages.
- **Step 3**: Modify adapters if necessary to accommodate the use of external configurations.
- **Step 4**: Implement security measures (encryption, access control).
- **Step 5**: Develop the administrative interface for managing configurations.
- **Step 6**: Update documentation to reflect these changes.
- **Step 7**: Write tests to validate configuration retrieval and message dispatching.

#### Example Flow

1. **Incoming Message Processing**

   - Message arrives and is transformed into the universal format.
   - The message is processed asynchronously by the external app.

2. **Outbound Message Dispatching**

   - When ready to send an outbound message, the `message_dispatcher` retrieves the necessary configuration based on the `platform` and identifiers in the `MessageModel`.
     ```python
     config = configuration_service.get_config(
         platform=message.platform,
         receiver_id=message.receiver_id,
         conversation_id=message.metadata.get('conversation_id')
     )
     ```
   - The dispatcher uses the retrieved `token`, `webhook_url`, and other parameters to send the message.
   - The outbound message is sent without the processing app needing to know about the underlying configurations.

#### Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns**: Keeps the message processing logic clean and focused only on message content.
- **Scalability**: Easily manage configurations for multiple platforms and clients.
- **Maintainability**: Update configurations without touching the codebase.
- **Security**: Centralized management of sensitive data reduces risk.

### Updated Next Steps:

1. **Develop Configuration Management System**
   - Implement the `ConfigurationModel` and configuration service.
   - Ensure secure storage and retrieval of configurations.
   - Integrate configuration retrieval into the `message_dispatcher`.

2. **Modify Message Dispatcher**
   - Update the dispatcher to use configurations when sending outbound messages.
   - Ensure it functions correctly across all platforms.

3. **Implement Administrative Interface**
   - Create a UI or API endpoints for managing configurations.
   - Implement authentication and authorization.

4. **Update Documentation**
   - Document the configuration management workflows.
   - Provide guidelines on how to add or update configurations.

5. **Testing**
   - Write unit and integration tests for the configuration service.
   - Test outbound message sending with various configurations.

6. **Review and Refine**
   - Review the entire message flow to ensure configurations are correctly applied.
   - Optimize performance and security as needed.
